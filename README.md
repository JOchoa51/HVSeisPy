# Spectral Analysis App

The Spectral Analysis app is a Python-based application that allows users to analyze seismic data from various file formats, including MSEED, CIRES, ASCII, and SAC files. The app provides a range of functionalities to process, visualize, and analyze seismic signals.

## Features

1. **Data Import**: The app supports reading data from MSEED, CIRES, ASCII, and SAC files, making it flexible for various seismic data formats.

2. **Seismogram Display**: Users can visualize the imported seismic data as seismograms, which provide an essential visual representation of the recorded signals.

3. **Window Length Selection**: The app allows users to specify the length of the analysis window for further processing.

4. **Taper Window Selection**: Users can choose from a range of taper windows to apply pre-processing to the seismic data.

5. **FFT Calculation**: The app enables users to calculate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the three components of the seismogram (north, vertical, and east). The FFT is displayed in a semilogx scale.

6. **H/V Spectrum Calculation**: Users can calculate the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) spectrum, which provides insights into the spectral characteristics of the seismic data.

7. **Display Options**: Users can choose to display either all analysis windows or just the mean value in the H/V spectrum.

## How to Use

1. **Data Import**: Load your seismic data by selecting the desired file format (MSEED, CIRES, ASCII, or SAC) from the "File" menu and selecting the appropriate file.

2. **Seismogram Display**: After importing the data, the app will automatically display the seismograms for each component (north, vertical, and east).

3. **Window Length Selection**: Adjust the analysis window length using the provided input controls.

4. **Taper Window Selection**: Choose the desired taper window from the drop-down menu.

5. **FFT Calculation**: Click the "Calculate FFT" button to compute the Fast Fourier Transform of the seismogram components and visualize them in a semilogx scale.

6. **H/V Spectrum Calculation**: Click the "Calculate H/V Spectrum" button to calculate the Horizontal-to-Vertical spectrum. Choose whether to display all analysis windows or just the mean value.

7. **Visualization**: The app will display the results in graphical plots, allowing you to analyze and interpret the seismic data.
